# Alternative: Skip C++ Compilation

Since Visual Studio C++ isn't installed, you have 3 options:

## Option 1: Install Visual Studio C++ (Recommended if you want to modify code)

Download: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

Install **"Desktop development with C++"** workload (about 6GB)

## Option 2: Use Pre-built Release (Fastest - I'll create this for you)

I can create a release build with the DLL already compiled. You can then:
1. Just run the installer
2. No compilation needed
3. Works on any Windows system

## Option 3: Stick with Original C# Version

The original `hta-to-webview2` project works fine without C++. The hybrid is just for better performance.

**Which would you prefer?**

I recommend **Option 2** - let me create a ready-to-run installer version that includes the pre-compiled DLL. This will work on any Windows system without requiring Visual Studio.

Want me to proceed with Option 2?
